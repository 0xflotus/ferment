[Ferment](http://ferment.audio) is a peer-to-peer audio publishing and streaming application. Think SoundCloud or Spotify, but entirely decentralized and free.

**Current Status**

Since our initial Alpha release last year, we have made vast improvements to our underlying [peer to peer communication network](https://github.com/ssbc). Armed with the knowledge we have learned from our Alpha release and our more robust peer to peer network, we are working on taking Ferment to the next level with a Beta release.
 
**Ferment Network is offline**

As we prepare our new Beta version, we have taken the main Ferment "pub" offline for updates. This means that until our next release, you will not be able to join the p2p network.

## Ferment and Copyright

Ferment is an audio publishing platform for **copyright-owning creators**, **creative commons licensed material**, **remix artists** and **DJs**. As this is a decentralized, peer-to-peer community, what you culture in your network is up to you. **You get to choose what level of sharing legality you are comfortable with.**

For example, if someone in your network adds copyrighted material, and you listen to it, your Ferment will start sharing the file. If you don't want to share the legal responsibility for this, right-click and select 'Stop Sharing Post.'

You could also consider unfollowing them and reporting the infringement to the owner of the pub to prevent the spread of the material.

**A pub owner should unfollow anyone who adds material which infringes copyright.**
