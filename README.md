# Ferment

[Ferment](http://ferment.audio) is a peer-to-peer audio sharing and streaming application. It's a lot like SoundCloud but instead of one corporation holding all the power, it is decentralized.

It is made possible by combining these **amazing** projects: [ssb](https://scuttlebot.io/), [webtorrent](https://webtorrent.io/) and [electron](http://electron.atom.io/).

## Experimental // EVERYTHING IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE AND BREAKING!

I'm just fiddling with ideas right now. My goal is to replace my need for SoundCloud as a [backyard musician that uploads WAY to much stuff](https://soundcloud.com/destroy-with-science). I no longer want to pay them $200 a year to host it all. Webtorrent to the rescue!

### The long-term vision ‚ú®

I want to see a thriving audio sharing community (actually would be COMMUNITIES! it's decentralized), a lot like soundcloud used to be before they went all MONETIZE (AND OH NOEZ, WE'RE GOING BANKRUPT üòû). No lock-in, no spam (it's based on ssb which makes spam very hard to exist), all open source! And all the community features that made old soundcloud great!

It should also be possible to host your own server that allows people without the app to stream music from your profile (or others that you want to seed). This will still be peer-to-peer but your server will act as a mirror and tracker.

## Requirements

You currently need to have `ffmpeg` on your system to add audio files. Until a packaged app installer is created, you need a modern version of `node` and `npm` installed in order to build.

## Joining Pub Server

By default, **Ferment** will only see other users that are on the same local area network as you. In order to share with users on the internet, you need to be invited to a pub server.

Since I'm a nice person üíñ you can hang out in my pub, and you don't even have to by any drinks! üçª

Click 'Join Pub' on the top bar of Ferment and paste the following code:

```
&PLACEHOLDERPLACEHOLDERPLACEHOLDERPLACEHOLDERPLACEHOLDERPLACEHOLDER=
```

If all goes to plan, you should start to see audio appear before your eyes! Give that play button a spin.

## Install

### from npm

```bash
$ npm install -g ferment
```

And then run using:

```bash
$ ferment
```

Install latest updates:

```bash
$ npm install -g ferment@latest
```

### from source

**Warning:** Development is done on the master branch, so this could be broken right now!

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/mmckegg/ferment.git
$ cd ferment
$ npm install
```

And then run using:

```bash
$ npm start
```

Install latest updates:

```bash
$ npm update
$ npm run rebuild # make sure native add-ons are compatible with electron version
```

## TODO

- [x] Scuttlebot database
- [x] Webtorrent streaming
- [x] Layout main application interface, base styles
- [x] Audio player interface
- [x] Sequencial feed playback
- [x] API for adding file (transcode, analyse waveform)
- [x] Upload interface [still needs more fields, and artwork]
- [x] Connect to local peers and merge streams
- [x] Store artwork in blobstore, and retrieve again
- [x] User setup (choose display name, bio, picture)
- [x] Specific Artist Feed
- [ ] Proper play/pause/loading buttons (nice try emoji)
- [ ] Make Save / Download button work
- [ ] Allow "delete" of audio posts (some kind of tombstoning)
- [ ] Likes
- [ ] Reposting
- [ ] Invite to pub
- [ ] Follow other users ("friends")
- [ ] Display following stats
- [ ] Playlists
- [ ] Show seed stats
- [ ] Backgrounding (keep seeding / syncing when main window is closed)
- [ ] Allow revisions (some kind of special reply that replaces the content with new content)
- [ ] Figure out a way to track listens? [Would be difficult given the decentralized nature of this. Might be better to show swarm strength or some other clever metric]
- [ ] Commenting? This is a pretty major part of soundcloud, but I'm personally not really a fan

### Server

- [ ] Pub server (invites, etc)
- [ ] Seed torrents from specified feeds
- [ ] Web interface for viewing specified feeds
